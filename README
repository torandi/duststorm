== Game Play ==
The goal of the game is to survive as long as possible. You travel along 
a rail and enemies appear. Use your particle canon to shoot them. For each
enemy you kill you gain score and life, but for each you miss, you lose health.
If your health reaches 0 you lose.

=== Firing ===
There is no limitation on how fast you can fire.

=== Breaking ===
You only need to tap the break button to break. This will apply the breaks for 3 seconds.
They will then be unusable for 10 seconds. "Breaks Ready" will appear in the lower left corner when
they can be use again.

=== Particle Types ===
You have three particle types:

Light: Great Area of Effect, but very light, and is thus much affected by the wind.
Medium: Short range weapon.
Heavy: Long range weapon.

== Controls ==
We recommend that you play with a wiimote (if you have one). 
Wiimote support is only implemented under windows, to activate it, specify the flag -w to the program
If you don't have an wiimote, a xbox 360 controll works rather well, and in worst case, use the mouse.

=== Wiimote ===
Aim: Roll controls horizontal aim, and pitch vertical aim
Fire: A-button
Break: B-button
Change particles: Left and right on the D-pad changes particles

=== Xbox 360 controller ===
You must press start (and not enter) to activate the xbox controller (and thus deactivating the mouse).
Pressing start or enter at any time switches between xbox and mouse

Aim: Left stick
Fire: A
Break: LB or B
Change particles: X and Y

=== Mouse and keyboard ===
Aim: Mouse
Fire: Left mouse button
Break: Space or right mouse button
Change particles: Wheel up/down or keys 1 and 2
